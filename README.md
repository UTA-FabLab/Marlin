# Additional Notes (For Deltas at FabLab):
1) The PID settings are obviously different as we are using the E3D hotend.

2) IMPORTANT: I've disabled the manual fan control. This was required for auto fan control. If performing PID Autotune, its best to switch to manual mode as for some reaon fan won't run when performing PID Autotune. Otherwise its best to keep automatic control enabled. Following controls this behavior:
 
       a) Configuration_adv.h [Line 117-127]:
          #define EXTRUDER_0_AUTO_FAN_PIN 8       // -1=Manual 8=Automatic
          define EXTRUDER_1_AUTO_FAN_PIN -1
          #define EXTRUDER_2_AUTO_FAN_PIN -1
          #define EXTRUDER_3_AUTO_FAN_PIN -1
          #define EXTRUDER_AUTO_FAN_TEMPERATURE 120
          #define EXTRUDER_AUTO_FAN_SPEED   255  // == full speed
       
       b) pins_RAMBO.h [Line 92]:
                    #define FAN_PIN            -1                        // 8=Manual -1=Automatic

3) Might need to modify the Z-heights in Configuration.h:
 
       a) Line 679: #define MANUAL_Z_HOME_POS 251.3 
       // This is the max height traveled by the Orion in Z. Might need to be changed if using the stock extruder. I found this be zeroing the nozzle to bed and observing the distance traveled. TIP: Repetier-Host manual control works best to observe how much the head has traveled.

       b) Line 420: #define Z_MAX_POS 235.0 // This HAS TO BE LESS THAN (a). If not might cause towers to crash during manual movement. Whatever value you obtain for (a) just subtract 15.0mm to get a safe value here.

4) I've enabled the rotary encoder and display. During prints, the rotary encoder acts as a print speed multiplier. To enable/disable (I've disabled this for FabLab), change 

       Line 304 in Configuration_adv.h: //  #define ULTIPANEL_FEEDMULTIPLY  // Comment to disable setting feedrate multiplier via encoder

5) The extruder steps still need calibration. Whatever value you get do tell me as well.

6) Lastly, I used the latest Arduino to compile this. To avoid compile errors and warnings, copy ArduinoAddons/Arduino_1.6.x/ to your Arduino directory.

## Release Candidate -- Marlin 1.1.0-RC3 - 01 December 2015

__Not for production use â€“ use with caution!__

Previously tagged versions of Marlin are not recommended. However, the latest patches to the Marlin 1.0 series can be found in the [1.0.x](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/1.0.x) branch.

[This branch, "RC"](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/RC), is our current pre-release candidate.

Future development takes place in the [MarlinDev repository](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/MarlinDev/).

## Recent Changes
RC3 - 01 Dec 2015
      A number of language sensitive strings have been revised
      Formatting of the LCD display has been improved to handle negative coordinates better
      Various compiler-related issues have been corrected

RC2 - 29 Sep 2015
      File styling reverted
      LCD update frequency reduced

RC1 - 19 Sep 2015
      Published for testing

## Submitting Patches
Proposed patches should be submitted as a Pull Request against the [RCBugFix](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/RCBugFix) branch
Note: Do not propose added features. Patches to the Release Candidate are limited to corrections of coding errors for the functions that have been implemented.
Please follow the proper style. Pull requests containing styling errors will have to be reworked.



## Current Status: Testing

Please test this firmware and inform us of any issues where it fails to perform in a manner consistent with the designed functionality.

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
